# Agents-Class LLM
This project content all the projects corresponding to my work done:
- Laboratory 6 
- Laboratory 7 
- Laboratory 8 ⬅️

### Features

- **AI-Driven Python Code Execution:** Implements a Python agent using PythonREPLTool to execute Python code dynamically.
- **CSV Data Analysis:** Creates a CSV agent for querying and analyzing data in the episode_info.csv file.
- **Grand Agent Coordination:** Combines multiple specialized agents (Python agent and CSV agent) under a "grand agent" for orchestrated task execution.
- **Toolset Definition:** Defines distinct tools with clear descriptions for transforming natural language inputs into actionable outputs.
- **Dynamic Query Processing:** Handles natural language queries about both Python tasks and CSV data analysis seamlessly.
- **Multi-Agent Versatility:** Enables the execution of both computational and analytical tasks using separate agents.
