# Agents-Class LLM

This project leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to create a versatile agent-based system capable of performing a variety of tasks. By integrating multiple specialized agents, the system can execute Python code, analyze CSV data, and coordinate complex workflows. The agents are designed to transform natural language inputs into actionable outputs, making it easier to perform computational and analytical tasks seamlessly.

### Features

- **AI-Driven Python Code Execution:** Implements a Python agent using PythonREPLTool to execute Python code dynamically.
- **CSV Data Analysis:** Creates CSV agents for querying and analyzing data in various CSV files.
- **Grand Agent Coordination:** Combines multiple specialized agents (Python agent and CSV agents) under a "grand agent" for orchestrated task execution.
- **Toolset Definition:** Defines distinct tools with clear descriptions for transforming natural language inputs into actionable outputs.
- **Dynamic Query Processing:** Handles natural language queries about both Python tasks and CSV data analysis seamlessly.
- **Multi-Agent Versatility:** Enables the execution of both computational and analytical tasks using separate agents.
- **Friendly User Experience:** Personalized frontend with Markdown/CSS integrated with streamlit

### CSV Contents

The CSV files contain the following information:
- **fortune_2000_in_2021.csv**: Fortune 2000 companies and their values in the market.
- **HBO_titles.csv**: HBO titles scores based on user ratings.
- **gold_price.csv**: Gold prices, all you need to know about the price of gold over time.
- **IQ_level.csv**: IQ levels classified by country.
